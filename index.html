            <h2>Why London?</h2>
            <h3>London, the Square Mile</h3>
            <p>
              London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the
              oldest of the world’s great cities—its history spanning nearly two
              millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s
              largest metropolis, it is also the country’s economic,
              transportation, and cultural center.
            </p>
            <p>
              As one of the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong
              influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce and
              finance, education, health care, media, science and technology,
              tourism, transport, and communications.

              <h4>Hamilton</h4>
              <p>
                Orphaned at a young age, Hamilton moved to New York in the hope
                of a better life. While there, there he impressed those around
                him with his hunger for revolution and reform. The story sees
                Hamilton become George Washington's right-hand man, fall in
                love, and go on to become the first Secretary of the Treasury of
                the United States.

              <h4>Les Miserables</h4>
              <p>
                The Les Misérables musical is set against the backdrop of
                19th-century France and tells a moving story of unrequited love,
                sacrifice, passion, redemption, and revolutionary spirit. The
                newly-free prisoner Jean Valjean builds a new, respectable life
                for himself but is hunted by the prison guard Javert, all while
                revolutionaries fight for freedom in France. Throughout the
                musical, audiences meet Fantine, Eponine, and Cosette, as well
                as the Thenardiers, and freedom fighters like Marius and
                Enjolras.

              <h4>The Book of Mormon</h4>
              <p>
                Follow the journey of two missionaries who dream of serving in
                Orlando, only to be told they must serve in Uganda. While in
                Africa, they share their scriptures with the local community.
                The locals don’t care about what they have to say: AIDS, famine,
                and warlords pose a more significant threat. Join Elder Price
                and Elder Cunningham as they spread the gospel and attempt to
                make every day a latter day.
